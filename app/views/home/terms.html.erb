<p>This agreement (this &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) is made and entered into by and between ContextSmith, Inc., with its principal offices at 440 North Wolfe Road, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 (“ContextSmith”) and Customer (as defined in the applicable Subscription Order). This Agreement describes the terms under which ContextSmith will make its services available to Customer.</p>
<p>The parties agree as follows:</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>1. ORDERING AND SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD</h5>
<p>1.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ordering.</span> By executing one or more subscription orders under this Agreement (each a “Subscription Order”), Customer may obtain access to the content, data, application program interface (“API”) and other features offered through ContextSmith&#8217;s proprietary platform of servers, software and technology (the “Services”). The specific Services available to Customer are identified in the Subscription Order. All use of the Services by Customer is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>1.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subscription Period.</span> The period of access to the Services will be specified in the applicable Subscription Order (“Subscription Period”) and if no period is specified, the Subscription Period will be twelve (12) months. A Subscription Order is not cancelable by Customer during a Subscription Period. At the end of the initial Subscription Period, the Subscription Period will automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms, unless Customer notifies ContextSmith in writing 60 days prior to the termination of the current Subscription Period, or as otherwise specified in a Subscription Order.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>2. PLATFORM USE AND RESTRICTIONS</h5>
<p>2.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">License.</span> ContextSmith hereby grants to Customer a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license to access the Services specified in the Subscription Order during the Subscription Period for its internal business purposes.</p>
<p>2.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account Password and Security.</span> Customer’s account with ContextSmith will provide Customer with access to the Services and the API and other functionality that ContextSmith may provide from time to time. Customer shall protect its passwords and take full responsibility for Customer&#8217;s own as well as any third party use of the Customer account. Customer is solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under its accounts, except for any activities performed by ContextSmith as set forth herein. Customer agrees to notify ContextSmith immediately upon learning of any unauthorized use of its account or any other breach of security. From time to time, ContextSmith&#8217;s support staff may log in to the Services under Customer’s password in order to maintain or improve the Services, including for the purpose of providing Customer assistance with technical or billing issues. Customer hereby acknowledges and consents to such access.</p>
<p>2.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Services Modifications.</span> ContextSmith is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its customers. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the form and nature of the Services that ContextSmith provides may be improved from time to time without prior notice to you, including without limitation security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements. Changes to the form and nature of the Services will be immediately effective with respect to all versions of the Services.</p>
<p>2.4 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Restrictions.</span> Customer shall not, and shall not permit its clients to: (i) resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise provide access to the Services, or data or information contained in or derived from the Services, to any third party or use the Services outside the scope of the license granted herein; (ii) copy, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Services or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or trade secrets related to the Services; or (iii) use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features or any copyright or other proprietary rights associated with the Services for any purpose without the express written consent of ContextSmith. Customer will indemnify, defend and hold ContextSmith harmless against any damages, losses, claims or judgments arising out of any violation of Section 2 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.5 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Training and Support.</span></p>
<p>2.5.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Training.</span> In consideration of Customer&#8217;s payment of training and support fees indicated in a Subscription Order, ContextSmith will provide the training and support services set forth in the Subscription Order. Training sessions will be conducted at ContextSmith&#8217;s facility and/or at Customer&#8217;s location. Customer will reimburse ContextSmith&#8217;s reasonable travel costs and living expenses incurred by ContextSmith’s employees and subcontractors for travel from ContextSmith’s offices in connection with the performance of training services.</p>
<p>2.5.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Support.</span> ContextSmith will make Services documentation available through its website. In addition, ContextSmith will provide online support at support@contextsmith.com during the hours of 8 am to 6 pm PT.  Additional support may be expressed in Subscription Order.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>3. TERM OF THE AGREEMENT</h5>
<p>The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until all Subscription Periods, including any renewals thereof, have been terminated.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>4. CHARGES, PAYMENT AND TAXES</h5>
<p>4.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Charges.</span> Customer will be billed for use of the Services in accordance with the applicable Subscription Order. The pricing specified in a Subscription Order will be firm for the initial term of the Subscription Order. ContextSmith may provide notice of an increase in pricing in advance of Subscription Period renewal.</p>
<p>4.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment.</span> Invoices will be due and payable thirty (30) days from date of invoice and will be paid in immediately available U.S. funds by wire transfer or other method as mutually agreed to by the parties. Any invoiced amount not paid by the due date will bear a late payment charge at the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month (or such lower amount as may be required by law) until paid.</p>
<p>4.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes.</span> Fees do not include and Customer shall pay, indemnify and hold ContextSmith harmless from all applicable sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST or other tax on the transactions contemplated herein, other than taxes based on the net income or profits of ContextSmith.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>5. CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>
<p>“Confidential Information” means, subject to the use license granted in Section 10.2, any non-public information relating to or disclosed in the course of this Agreement, including the Services and data or information contained in or derived from the Services. The receiving party will not share Confidential Information with third parties (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including Section 2), will use the same care to protect Confidential Information as it uses for its own similar information, but in no event less than reasonable care, and will use Confidential Information only as permitted in this Agreement and for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was already in possession of the receiving party without restriction; (c) is independently developed by the receiving party without violation of this Section; or (d) is received from a third party without restriction. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information if it is required to do so by law, so long as the receiving party provides the disclosing party with prompt notice and complies with any protective order imposed on such disclosure. At the request of the disclosing party, the receiving party will return all of the other party’s Confidential Information that is reduced to writing(s), drawing(s), schematic(s), or any other form of documentation, or destroy all such material, and permanently delete if in electronic form, and to certify the destruction to the disclosing party, provided however, if the Agreement is not terminated for cause, the Customer may retain copies of the reports or information printed or obtained through the Services subject at all times to the license restrictions specified in Section 2.4 and the non-disclosure requirements of this Section 5.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>6. TERMINATION</h5>
<p>6.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Cause.</span> Either party may terminate this Agreement and all Subscription Orders, immediately upon written notice to the other party, if the other party: (a) commits a material breach of this Agreement, which is capable of remedy, and fails to remedy the breach within thirty (30) days after written notice; (b) commits a material breach of this Agreement which cannot be remedied; or (c) is repeatedly in breach of this Agreement. Abuse or excessive usage of the Services API beyond the scope permitted under a Subscription Order will be deemed a material breach justifying ContextSmith’s termination or suspension of a Customer’s account.</p>
<p>6.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effect of Termination.</span> Upon termination of this Agreement, all license rights hereunder will immediately terminate and Customer will: (i) cease use of the Services, including all data or information contained in or derived from the Services; (ii) destroy or (if requested by ContextSmith) return to ContextSmith all copies or other embodiments of the any and all data or information contained in or derived from the Services, and all other ContextSmith Confidential Information; and (iii) pay to ContextSmith all amounts due and owing under this Agreement.</p>
